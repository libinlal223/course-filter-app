##  How It Works

1. The app loads a local array of course objects.  
2. The search bar filters the displayed list dynamically.  
3. The sort button cycles through *Normal*, *Low → High*, and *High → Low* price views.  
4. The top-rated course is highlighted in a separate “Top Course” section.

No libraries. No frameworks. 100% vanilla JavaScript.
